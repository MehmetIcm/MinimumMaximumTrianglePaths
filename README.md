# MinimumMaximumTrianglePaths
 An application made to find the minimum path from triangular numbers
 
 We want to finding minimum path at this triangle:
                       7
                  6        3
            3          8       5
      11         2         10       9
     
Etc:7-6-3-2
We can think of each row as a list so we can build the main skeleton
After, we can use loop for getting values and calculating
